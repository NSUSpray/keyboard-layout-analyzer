ABSTRACT
T he aim of this research work was to study the preformulation parameters of Carbamazepine which is use for the treatment of partial
and tonic-clonic seizure disorders. Carbamazepine is a first-line drug used for the treatment of partial and tonic-clonic seizures. It is also the drug
of choice for use during pregnancy and recommended for the treatment of seizure disorders in children. Variability in the preformulation
properties of the Carbamazepine can "spoil" the enormous effort spent on the development if the effects of such variability are not well understood.
All preformulation parameters of drug were performed with respect of critical quality attributes during development of tablet formulation, it
include Infrared spectral studies, Melting point, Assay of API, Determination of solubility and Determination of wavelength
of maximum absorbance . Furthermore, studies were conducted to assess the Particle Size Analysis and thermal transitions of Carbamazepine using
Differential scanning calorimetry.
Keywords: Preformulation, Critical Quality Attributes, Particle Size Analysis, Differential Scanning Calorimetry.

INTRODUCTION
T he generic industry relies in major part on the
publicly available information and through literature research it
tries to minimize unnecessary experimentation. Unfortunately
sometimes only small amount of data is available and if the
preformulation studies are not conducted formulators must rely on
their experience to predictions based on the reactivity of the
functional groups present in the active pharmaceutical ingredient
(API) and thus they design a product using excipient that will
minimize the anticipated degradation.
Since, many of generic companies are not synthesizing
active ingredients for their formulation; they are directly
dependent on drug producers. As the formulator cannot rely only
on the specification provided by the supplier of bulk drug,
preformulation studies in that case are extremely important during
selection of the best raw material for the formulation of the dosage
form and the most reliable manufacturer which will provide the
active materials of consistently high quality and without batch to
batch variation. Moreover, the generic product manufacturer must
sometimes change the source of bulk drug due to market
fluctuation. Hence, it is necessary to specify the critical parameters
for each drug which will be monitored in order to control
variability during the selection of new raw materials if there is a
need for it [1] .
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Preformulation study:
Preformulation is a stage of drug development during
which physicochemical and mechanical properties of a compound
are investigated, understood and effectively utilized. In other
words, the objective of preformulation studies is to develop a
portfolio of information about the drug substance to serve as a set
of parameters against which detailed formulation design can be

carried out. Preformulation investigations are designed to identify
those physicochemical properties of drug substances and
excipients that may influence the formulation design, method of
manufacture, and pharmacokinetic-biopharmaceutical properties
of the resulting product [1] .
Identifying the key issues (critical parameters) prior to
development will ultimately expedite product development
minimizing risk-associated mistakes. Preformulation testing
provides the necessary physicochemical and physicomechanical
properties of drug and excipient at the early stage of development
to allow a logical, scientific approach to formulation optimization.
The best products can be regarded as being those that are simple,
elegant and robust. There is a greater chance of achieving such a
product if the correct foundations are laid and an understanding of
the potential problems has been obtained by rigorous
preformulation testing. The term "preformulation studies" is often
used for a development of newly synthesized drug compounds, but
it is also an extremely important stage during the development of
generic drugs. For a generic drug to be approved by the authorities
it must be shown to be pharmaceutically equivalent and
bioequivalent to the reference drug product. Pharmaceutically
equivalent means the identical amounts of the same active
ingredient in the same dosage form and for the same route of
administration [2, 3] .
Carbamazepine (CBZ):
Carbamazepine (CBZ) is selected as a model drug for the
study it is a first-line drug used for the treatment of partial and
tonic-clonic seizures. It is also the drug of choice for use during
pregnancy and recommended for the treatment of seizure
disorders in children. CBZ possesses the ability to induce
metabolism of drugs that are transformed in the liver and has the
unique ability to induce its own metabolism by a phenomenon
known as 'auto-induction', where its biological half-life is
significantly reduced during chronic administration. Large doses of
CBZ are often prescribed as daily divided doses and this often
adversely affects patient compliance, with the result that therapy is
ineffective. A sustained-release dosage form containing CBZ is
currently marketed as Tegretol ® CR.
Carbamazepine is pharmacologically active within a
narrow therapeutic range. Consequently, chronic drug therapy in
epileptic patients requires steady-state plasma concentrations
with minimal fluctuations below the minimum effective
concentration or above the maximum toxic concentration, in order

to prevent seizure relapse or the occurrence of adverse side
effects. Sustained release delivery systems of CBZ with controlled
and predictable release kinetics, when compared to conventional
dosage forms are likely to result in improved drug therapy. The use
of a sustained-release dosage form for the delivery of CBZ may
therefore be appropriate and desirable to enhance patient
adherence with the added advantage of minimal fluctuations in
plasma CBZ levels. Furthermore, the use of simple controlled
release technology may result in the availability of a more cost-
effective therapeutic option for epileptic patients stabilized on CBZ
[4, 5] .
The chemical structure of CBZ was depicted in Figure 1.
It has an empirical formula of C 15 H 12 N 2 O and possesses a molecular
weight of 236.26 g/mol [6] .

Fig. 1: Carbamazepine
CBZ is most frequently prescribed for patients who have
failed to respond to first-line anticonvulsant therapy or for those
who develop significant side-effects from other anticonvulsant
agents large doses often ensue as treatment progresses and this is
principally due to the auto-inducing properties of CBZ.
Preformulation study:
Description of drug:
The drug sample of Carbamazepine was visually
analysed for colour and state. The visual method consisted of
viewing approximately 50 mg of Carbamazepine sample placed on
a white sheet of paper under laboratory lighting. The color of the
Carbamazepine was recorded by each analyst without the
knowledge of what the other analyst had recorded [7] .
Infrared spectral studies:
FTIR spectra of Carbamazepine was obtained using
Perkin Elmer1600 FTIR spectrophotometer using diffuse
reflectance technique (KBr disc technique) as a part of qualitative
analysis by comparing it with the spectra of USP standard [6] .
Sample of drug powder was mixed dried with KBr. The
KBr discs were prepared by compressing the powder and the scans
were obtained in the mid-infrared regions of the spectrum from
4000 cm -1 - 400 cm -1 at resolution of 1cm -1 .
Melting point:
Melting point of Carbamazepine was dermined with the
help of capillary fusion method. Apparatus consists of a glass
container for a bath of transparent fluid, a suitable stirring device,
an accurate thermometer and a controlled source of heat. Light
paraffin is used for bath fluid. The fluid is deep enough to permit
immersion of the thermometer to its specified immersion depth so
that the bulb is still about 2 cm above the bottom of the bath. The
heat is supplied by an open flame. The capillary tube is about 10
cm long and 0.8 to 1.2 mm in internal diameter with walls 0.2 to
0.3 mm in thickness [8] .
DSC Curve:
DSC Curve of API was recorded for identification,
Differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) analyses of the CBZ was
carried out by using a differential scanning calorimeter equipped
with computer analyzer (Shimadzu TA-60 differential scanning
calorimeter, Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan). Samples (3-7
mg) were heated in a nitrogen atmosphere on an aluminium pan at
a heating rate of 10 C/min over the temperature range of 60-200
°C [9] .
Particle Size Analysis:
Particle size distribution measurement was performed
on Malvern Particle Size Analyzer (Software: Masterizer 2000,
Version-5.22) using Wet unit Hydro 2000S. Sample dispersion was
made in liquid paraffin and about 5ml of sample dispersion was
added to Hydro 2000S unit and recorded the measurement after
about 1 min so that obscuration value lies within 10-20%. With the
software (Malvern) the particle size distribution, including mean
and median particle size was calculated from raw data [10, 11] .
Assay of API:
Assay of API is done for purity, HPLC system was use to
determine the assay of Carbamazepine [13] .
Determination of solubility:
Carbamazepine solubility was performed at
laboratories, according to the recommendation of guidelines for
Biopharmaceutical classification system (BCS) of drug substance
[11, 13] .
Determination of λ m (Standard calibration curve):
Standard curve of Carbamazepine was prepared with
different pH range. Different concentration solutions of drug were
prepared and absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically
using Systronics double beam UV-Visible spectrophotometer-2101
[12, 13] .

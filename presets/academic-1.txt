At a time when e-learning is increasingly being employed as an educational
alternative to traditional face-to-face learning, there is evidence that the
preferable educational mode may actually be blended learning, which is a
combination of e-learning and face-to-face learning. To date, little research
appears to have been done on the costs incurred by an educational program
that is transitioning from a wholly traditional system to one that may
include both e-learning and face-to-face classes. This paper presents a cost
minimization model for adjusting the mixture of e-learning and face-to-face
learning in a university program moving from a wholly traditional to a
blended-learning model. Given several basic assumptions, we derive a model
for the distribution of face-to-face and e-learning that minimizes the total
cost for both students and the institution. We present an application of the
model and draw conclusions.

Introduction

Knowledge management includes the basic educational mission of
determining the best strategies for transmitting knowledge to students so
they are well prepared for future employment. Given new and emerging
technologies that enable e-learning, a number of studies have focused on the
strengths and weaknesses of this mode of learning in respect to fulfilling the
educational mission. However, limited research has been reported on the
theoretical analysis of the costs incurred by a transition from a wholly face-
to-face (f2f) university-based program to a successful technology-facilitated
off-campus study program that includes e-learning classes.
 The main objective of the present study is to provide a model for
analysing the replacement of all or part of a university program, that has
until now been taught using traditional means, with e-learning, with a focus
on how to minimise costs implicated in the transition phase. In Section 2,
we present an overview of studies that examine the present educational
situation. In Section 3, there is an analysis of our model for cost
minimization in the university, and in Section 4, we examine the application
of the model and present certain results. Section 5 presents conclusions.
Literature review
Traditionally, higher education students have attended classes in physical
classrooms face-to-face (f2f) with instructors, while in distance education
students take classes outside the traditional classroom (Narodowski, Nores,
& Manolakis, 2002). Today, distance learning is being revolutionized by
information and communication technologies in the form of e-learning,
which offers considerable convenience and flexibility to the student (LaBay
& Comm, 2003). The primary tools of e-learning are technological, including
computers, the Internet, and digital storage and playback devices (Keller &
Cenerud, 2002), enabling access to learning programs at any time via
computer (Raymond, 2000). These tools drive change to which universities
must respond by becoming more flexible (Jones & O'Shea, 2004). Indeed,
Oakley (1997) suggested that universities that do not respond are likely to
become obsolete.
 However, responding appropriately to the new technology does not
entail that universities should convert their educational systems entirely to

e-learning. Many commentators note that distance/e-learning does not fully
substitute for traditional education. Teacher-student interactions are crucial
in higher education (McCain, 2002), and a great deal of learning occurs in
the classroom between students (Bose, 2003). Thus, traditional and e-
learning need not be seen as alternatives (Cedefop, 2001); rather, universities
should consider mixing the best possibilities of f2f and distance/e-learning
(Ess, 2003). This blended approach, in which the institution combines
traditional f2f education and e-learning, can provide increased flexibility to
educators (Linkaityte, Valiuskeviciute, Cubajevaite, & Zilinskaite, 2005).
 Insofar as e-learning modes are combined with traditional f2f or
classroom learning, the term "blended learning" can be applied (Bentley,
Selassie, & Parkin 2012). Blended learning has been considered to constitute
a new paradigm for education (Chen & Yao, 2016) and has been proposed as
the most attractive and effective approach for learning (Gunter 2001). A
recent meta-analysis of research on the effectiveness of e-learning and
blended learning in comparison to f2f instruction suggests that overall,
students in blended learning programs have better outcomes than those
who learn solely in face-to-face settings (Means, Toyama, Murphy, Bakia, &
Jones, 2010). Moreover, studies suggest that higher education students prefer
blended learning to solely online learning (Precel et al., 2009, Ioakimidis et
al., 2011).
 In choosing how to blend traditional and e-learning, the particular
instructional task should determine the mix (Linkaityte et al., 2005).
Educators must understand that course design and instructional design are
extremely important parts of e-learning. Because e-learners must generally
work alone, they may feel isolated (McInnerney & Roberts, 2004).
Conversely, student perceptions of the presence of other students and the
instructor in e-learning have been found to be associated with learning
satisfaction (Russo & Benson, 2004). Moreover, social communication
appears to be as important in e-learning as in the traditional classroom
(Peters, 1998). Thus, in designing e-learning coursework, special attention
should be paid to facilitating student-student and student-instructor
communication. Here again, the value of blended learning surfaces because
it enables the e-learner to have face-to-face contact with fellow students and
the instructor. Even when most of the coursework is done via e-learning,
having at least a few face-to-face meetings may be valuable. For example,
Hodgkinson (2002) found that e-learning students provided with the

opportunity for f2f orientation believed it would help them in class
participation.
 Due to increased competition, there is substantial pressure on
higher education institutions to be more cost-effective in the delivery of
services (Whitaker, 2003). However, there is disagreement on whether
application of technology will decrease costs for most universities. Simmons
(2001) maintained that distance education through e-learning provides
questionable economic benefits for universities, and Ruth (2006) held that
with current university staffing norms, there are serious financial drawbacks
for traditional schools. On the other hand, Whitaker (2003) held that the
appropriate use of technology can help conserve needed institutional
resources. For example, use of a blended approach that requires less physical
classroom time from students can financially benefit the institution by
freeing up classrooms and reducing new building costs (Ruth, 2006).
Whichever side is correct, the argument may be moot, for all universities are
in fact using blended approaches to some degree, as f2f education and e-
learning converge (Bose, 2003).
 Indeed, e-learning has become a necessity (Ruth, 2006), and it is
imperative for institutions of higher education to understand the costs of its
various implementations. While this is difficult due to constantly changing
technology (Wentling & Park, 2002), various costing models have been
proposed. These include the University of Virginia Distance Learning Cost
Model (ICASIT, 2001). Use of the model suggests that costs per course
section vary widely, but that courses and programs become more cost
effective with increased enrollment, decreased use of space, and reliance on
part-time faculty after development of content.
 Levin and Woo (1981) suggested the following procedure for
estimating the cost effectiveness of educational technologies: list resources,
determine costs for each resource based on actual costs or estimated market
values, and convert costs into analytical categories, such as annualized costs
and marginal costs. Laurillard (2006) held that a cost-benefit modeling tool
should define benefits and associated cost parameters, focus on staff time
costs, represent learner value in terms of time use, represent technology-
specific benefits and improvements in learning, and support local
exploration of the cost-benefit relationship. Another costing model
considers institutional costs of e-learning under three heads: developing
web-based materials, delivery, and initial overhead costs (Rumble, 2001).

 None of these models had the objective of analysing the costs of
replacing all or part of a program that had been taught using traditional
means with e-learning. The present paper focuses on this issue, including
how to minimize costs in the transition phase.
The model for adjusting the level of blended curriculum
design based on total cost
The cost-minimization model for adjusting the mixture of e-learning and f2f
educational procedures takes into consideration some basic assumptions.
There must be an educational institution offering a program divided into a
number of courses or learning modules. A number of students registered to
the program have to attend these courses, some of which are compulsory
and some optional. The institution has established the required background
technology to support asynchronous e-learning in an efficient way. We
assume that there exists a computer center with appropriate web,
application, and database servers; a learning management system; and
lessons in electronic format for all the offered courses. The computer center
has technical staff and programmers for developing the educational
material. The operational costs for running this e-learning centre and for
developing the e-learning modules, although significant, are regarded as
common to all the other educational activities of the institution and does
not affect directly the cost of the program under consideration. However,
this setup requires a minimum number of courses to be given by e-learning,
thus comprising one of the parameters of the model. For better
implementation of the instructional design of the program, some specific
courses of it should be offered by f2f. The rest can be offered both as f2f or e-
learning.
 The model considers as important some cost factors that are on the
part of both the student and the institution. These are dedicated either to e-
learning or to the f2f type of courses/learning modules. For the institution
only direct costs for the particular program are considered. Other
operational costs for running the institution are regarded as indifferent for
the model. Costs considered in the model are course/module dependent. For
a typical course, the cost factors are shown in Table 1.

 For implementation of the model, a number of parameters are
needed to express the information required and the restrictions of the
problem. These are presented in Table 2.

Table 2: The parameters of the model

 The model is formulated as an "assignment problem," which is one
of the fundamental optimization problems in the field of operational
research (Munkres, 1957, Algorithms and Theory of Computation Handbook,
1999). An assignment problem attempts to assign workers to tasks,
considering a cost function for each particular assignment. In our case, the
workers are the courses/modules and the task is the association of a
course/module to the e-learning or the f2f method of delivering it. The cost
involved in the two cases is the cost for both students and the institution, as
it is estimated for each particular course/module, when its characteristics
described in Table 1 are taken into account. The assignment should
minimize the total cost function for all the courses/modules.
 Following the terminology and the formulation of the assignment
problem, we define
i
x as a binary variable to distinguish whether the
course/module should be offered f2f or with e-learning method. If the

course/module i is offered as e-learning, then 1
i
x  ; otherwise, for the case
of f2f, 0
i
x  .
 In each course i , a number of
i
n students may be registered, no
matter if this course is defined as compulsory or optional. The total number
of teaching hours in e-learning and f2f cases is represented by ,
e f
i i
h h
respectively.
 The total cost for both students and institution is analyzed as
follows.
 For the f2f case, the cost put on the part of the institution, say f
i
C ,
is the cost for instructors' payroll, i.e.,
2
f
i
h c , and the cost for production and
distribution of educational materials such as books, handouts, etc., which is
proportional to the number of students, i.e.,
4 i
n c . The cost for the student is
analyzed as an average amount for daily expenses (transportation, food, etc.)
plus the opportunity cost (measured in an hourly basis), which is
6 7
f
i i
n c h c  . From the above, the total cost that derives for the f2f part is
2 4 6 7
f f f
i i i i i
C h c n c n c h c     .
 For the case of e-learning (asynchronous), the cost which overloads
a student is the cost for Internet/communication services measured by the
hours spent in front of the computer, i.e.,
5
e
i
h c , plus the special fee for
entering the e-learning course
3 i
n c (and maybe to attend an orientation
course). That is,
3 5
e
i i
n c h c  . The cost for the institution is the cost for the
e-tutors for the total hours of teaching and supervision, i.e.,
1
e
i i
h t c (we
assume that an e-learning class should have such a number of students that
will require
i
t e-tutors for the whole class). The cost for the e-learning
module is now set to
1 3 5
e e e
i i i i i
C h t c n c h c    .
 As there is no initial information available about the distribution of
the courses/modules between f2f and e-learning, and the model is free to be
assigned to both instructional methods, there must be a restriction for the
minimum level of e-learning involvement expressing the need for the
institution to support its setup for e-learning. This is expressed by the

When model (1) is solved, the distribution between f2f and e-learning that
minimizes the total cost for both students and the institution is derived.
An application of the model
To demonstrate the model, in this section we present an application
concerning a 2 years postgraduate program (3 semesters course studies + 1
semester dissertation writing) in the field of business administration and
economics offered by a Greek university. That particular program consists of
17 different courses/modules among which are Business Statistics,
Determining the Level of Blended e-Learning Using a Cost Optimization Model

Managerial Economics, Macroeconomics, Management and Marketing,
Project Management, Business Strategy & Policy, Financial Accounting,
Strategic IS, Human Resources Management, etc. Twelve of the offered
courses/modules are compulsory and the other 5 are optional, from which
students have to choose three courses/modules. For each one of the
modules a number of students is registered. In order an elective course to be
offered a minimum of 10 students is required to select it. For the compulsory
modules the number of students is 35.
 The required data and the parameters of the model are presented in
Table 3.

 For the estimation of the cost factors involved, the following
arrangements have been made.
 The e-tutor payment (cost factor C1) is estimated at up to 45€ per
hour (according to the average monthly wage of an e-tutors in
Greece).
Determining the Level of Blended e-Learning Using a Cost Optimization Model

11
Vol. VII, Issue 4
August 2017
 The instructor payment in f2f (cost factor C2) is estimated at 85€ per
hour (according to the average monthly wage of an instructor in
Greece).
 The cost (fee) for entering an e-learning course/module (cost factor
C3) depends on the particular course and its duration. It ranges
between 75€ and 140€.
 The cost for educational material, C4, depends on the size and the
type of the course/module. It ranges between 30€ and 120€.
 The cost category C5 represents mostly the Internet connection fees
that a student must pay in order to have full access to the distance/
e-learning environment of the university. This depends on the hours
required for attending an e-learning course/module.
 Cost category C6 consists of the daily expenses that a student
following a traditional course of study will face. This last category
includes costs like transportation or monthly rental of a house-
apartment in case the university is located far from his/her
hometown etc and is calculated on an hourly basis.
 Finally, cost category C7 represents the value of lost productivity or
in other words the lost remunerated productivity of students who
potentially would enter the job market if they did not continue their
studies (we assume that an employed graduate student will earn at
least the minimum wage for this case, so in an 8 hour workday we
can calculate his hourly opportunity cost which is approximately
€2.95). It must be pointed out that opportunity cost to those who
study remotely and in an asynchronous base is considered to be
close to zero, if not zero, as these students study from their home
and may be able to generate some income in addition to following a
course of studies remotely.
 All numbers of the above cost categories are based on equivalent
figures that are reported in several Greek studies (Ioakimidis, 2007) and also
from the Greek ministry of Education, Research and Religious Affairs (2012).
Model (1) is solved by using the data of Table 3 and by setting . The obtained
results are presented in Table 4. According to these results, five
courses/modules (1, 3, 7, 8, and 17) are chosen to be offered as f2f and the
rest as e-learning.

 The total cost for all the courses/ modules is set to C = 421.242€,
while if all the courses/modules were chosen as f2f, the total cost would be
579.385€. The cost if all courses were offered via e-learning would be
450.217€.
Conclusions
Even if universities and colleges are taking a sober approach to the
implementation of technological means of learning, distance education,
especially in the form of e-learning, has generated a revolution in many of
the ways in which education is delivered, without fundamentally changing
the very nature of learning itself. In fact, distance learning works best when
it enters the production function without changing pre-existing educational
models: the tools have changed, but the outcome remains fundamentally the
same. It should be strongly affirmed that e-learning and classroom-based

methods of training are not necessarily alternatives to each other and may
be complementary. While for suppliers of training, greater use of e-learning
goes with less use of classroom-based methods, for users this is much less
the case (Cedefop, 2001).
 One should never assume that change must be absolute. For each
program that has the potential to be offered online, a "mix and match"
approach may be taken, combining the most suitable aspects of traditional
and electronic learning respectively. As Owen et al. (2004) state, "it is
possible to mimic the richness of a traditional in-class experience when we
move to online course applications but ... we need to know exactly what is
being lost (or gained) with respect to educational outcomes."
 The model described in this paper could serve as a decision making
aid as well, especially in the case when a potential university manager has to
evaluate university programs or courses offered in different environments
aiming cost minimization.

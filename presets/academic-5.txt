INTRODUCTION
T he Schiff base are important class of ligand in
coordination chemistry and find extensive applications in different
fields for example, Schiff base compounds with metal ions and their
metal complexes have been highly considered in medicine,
engineering [1-4] , industrial, biological, analytical and therapeutical [5-
8] .
Schiff base are also condensation products of primary
amines with carbonyl compounds and produced ligands were
metaled by transition metal salts without any complication in its
preparation [9] .
Pyrazole is doubly unsaturated five membered ring
compound having three carbone and two nitrogen atoms. Several
pyrazoline substitution products are used in medicine [10] . 4-amino
antipyrine, an antipyretic agent is one of the pyrazole derivatives.
For the next years, antipyrine became the most widely used drug in
the world, proving highly successful for treating fever and flu-like
infection [11] . Some of pyrazolones derivatives are now included in
many of commercialized drug of brain ischemia and myocardial
ischemia [12] .
In the present work , synthesized and spectral studies of
of Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II) complexes of Schiff base ligand
derived from 4-amino antipyrine ,benzil and p-methoxy aniline .

MKI was employed for this purpose. The diamagnetic corrections
were made by Pascal's constants. Molar conductance measurements
were determined in DMSO by using an Alpha Digital conductivity
meter model 800. Physical characterization of the ligand and its
metal chelate complexes was listed in Table 1.
Preparation of Schiff base ligand (MPIHP):
1. Schiff base ligand is prepared by condensation reaction of 4-
amino antipyrine (2.03gm, 0.01 mol) dissolved in ethanol 50
ml was added to ethanolic solution 50 ml of benzil ( 2.1 gm ,
0.01 mol ) and few drops of glacial acetic acid were added to
reaction mixture with continues stirring and refluxing at 75
C◦ for (18h) ,the product precipitate was filtered and
recrystallized from hot ethanol and dried over anhydrous
CaCl 2 .
2. The new Schiff base ligand was prepared by condensation of
compound( E)-1,5-dimethyl-4-(2-oxo-1,2-
diphenylethylideneamino)-2-phenyl-1H-pyrazol-3(2H)-one
and p-methoxy aniline in eqimolar (1:2) mole ratio, in
Absolut alcohol ,few drops of glacial acetic acid were added
to the reaction mixture and refluxed for (24h) the product
was recrystallized from ethanol and dried over anhydrous
CaCl 2 . M.p (102-104) C◦, Scheme. 1.
Preparation of metal complexes:
 The metal complexes were prepared by the mixing of 30
ml ethanolic solution of (CoCl 2 .6H 2 O, NiCl 2 .6H 2 O, CuCl 2 .2H 2 O, and
ZnCl 2 ) with 30 ml ethanolic solution of Schiff base ligand in (1:1)
metal:ligand ratio. The resulting mixtures were refluxed of 2h, the
product were isolated after reduction of volume by evaporation. The
precipitated solid complexes were filtered off, washed with hot
ethanol to remove any traces of the unreacted starting materials.
Finally, the complexes were dried under vacuum.
Determination of bacteriological activity:
 Two pathogenic biological, Escherichia coli and
staphylococcus aureus, were used to test the antimicrobial activity of
the ligand and its metal complexes. The nutrient agar (NA) medium
was prepared and aquantity of (10ml) of the medium was poured in
to the sterilized petriplates and allowed to solidify. The plates were
inoculated with spore suspensions of pathogenic bactericides .By
using the sterilized cork bore,wells were dug in the center of the
center of the culture plates .The test complexes solution in DMSO
was added (0.5 ml) to these wells and the plates were incubatied at
25 C for 24 hour. Thenthe inhibition zone appeared around the wells
in each plate was measured and recorded as the cytotxic effect of the
appropriate complexes.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Identification of ligand and its metal complexes:
The azomethine was synthesized in good yield by
condensation of 4-amino antipyrine with benzil and substituted
aromatic amine in solid state. The new Schiff base stable at room
temperature and soluble in common organic solvent, such as DMF,
DMSO, slightly soluble in ethanol and methanol, but prooly soluble
in water. The metal complexes were characterized by elemental
analysis, molar conductance, IR and UV-Vis spectra. The elemental
analyses of the complexes indicate that the (metal:ligand) ratios
were (1:1) where M= Co(II), Ni(II), Cu(II) and Zn(II), yield
complexes corresponding to the general formula [ML(H 2 O)Cl 2 ].
Acording to the molar conductivity measurements the complexes of
the ligand did not show an important conductivity. This proves that
complexes have non- electrolytic nature. The magnetic
susceptibilities of the complexes at room temperature were
consistent an octahedral geometry around the central metal ion.
Physical and analytical data of the ligand and its complexes are
listed in Table 1.
Microanalysis:
The elemental analysis data the complexes as shown in
Table 1 exhibit the formation 1:1 [M:L] ratio it was found that the
theoretical values are in a good agreement with the found data. The
purity of the Schiff base ligand was tested by TLC technique and C, H
and N elemental analyses.
IR spectra:
The most important IR bands of the Schiff base ligand and
their complexes are given in table.2. In IR spectrum of the ligand a
sharp band observed at 1663 cm -1 is assigned to the υ (C=N) mode
of the azomethine group [13] . This shift to lower wave number at
(1606-1609) cm -1 in all complexes suggesting the coordination of
the azomethine nitrogen to the metal centers [14, 15] . The ligand acts
as tridentate chelating agent, bonded to the metal ion via the three
nitrogen υ (C=N) atoms of the Schiff base .The infrared of all
complexes exhibited a broad band in the range 3400-3390 cm -1 due
to υ(OH) of the coordinated H 2 O. This is supported by the
appearance of an additional band in the rang 818-840 cm -1 for (O-H)
vibration deformation. These bands were not observed in the
spectra of the ligand [16] . The mode of coordination is further
supported by the presence of new bands in (430-488) cm -1 and (500-
525)cm -1 ranges are due to (M-N) and (M-O) stretching vibrations
[17, 18] . Representative example for there is given in Fig. 1.
Magnetic and Electronic Spectral studies:
 The magnetic moments and electronic spectral bands of
the complexes are summarized in Table 3. The Schiff base ligand
showed a strong band at 285 nm, these band assigned to π-
π*transition involving molecular orbitals essentially localized on the
azomethine chromophore and benzene ring .In addition the ligand
exhibit a low intense band in the 306 nm region, involving n- π*
excitation .For complexes, the magnetic moment of cobalt (II)
complex (4.72 B.M) suggests a high-spin octahedral geometry [19] .
The electronic spectrum of this complex showed three absorption
bands at 14810 cm -1 , 16546 cm -1 and 23853cm -1 , assigned to
4 T 1 g(F)→ 4 T 2 g(F) (υ 1 ), 4 T 1 g(F)→ 4 A 2 g(F) (υ 2 ) and 4 T 1 g(F)→ 4 T 1 g(p)
(υ 3 ) transition respectively, which are characteristic of octahedral
stereo geometry [20] . For the nickel (II) complex, its magnetic
moment (3.16 B.M), and d-d spectrum of this complex showed
bands at 13192 cm -1 and 14409 cm -1 , which are suggesting the
existence of 3 A 2 g→ 3 T 1 g (υ 2 ) and 3 A 2 g→ 3 T 1 g(P) (υ 3 ) transitions with
an octahedral spatial configuration [21] . The magnetic moment value
of the copper (II) complex (1.81 BM) which may suggest an
octahedral structure, Its electronic spectrum shows a band centered
at 15197 cm -1 which may assigned to 2 Eg→ 2 T 2 g transition in
octahedral environment [22] . The electronic spectra of the ligand and
the Co(II), complex are shown in Fig. 2.
 Zinc(II) metal complex was diamagnetic consistent with
the d 10 configuration and the electronic spectra of these complexes
exhibit high intense charge transfer transition which are assigned to
(INCT) [23] . The electronic transitions, magnetic properties and
conductivity values of the ligand and its complexes are listed in
Table 3.
Conductivity measurement:
Molar conductance data of the complexes were measured
in the solvent DMSO and the complexes were found to be non-
electrolytic nature [24] . Conductivity value of the chelate complexes
are lie in the range (4.87- 6.53) S. cm 2 .mol -1 . According to these
results the structural formula of the metal complexes may be
proposed as in Fig. 3.
Antibacterial activity:
The data of antimicrobial activates of the prepared ligand
and its complexes are given in Table 4, the result showed that the
complexes have more toxicity against the bacterial species than the
free ligand. This can be attributed to the tweeds chelation theory [25] .
The Zn +2 complex show good antibacterial activity against the strain
of bacterial taken under study when compared to the ligand of other
metal complexes taken for study.

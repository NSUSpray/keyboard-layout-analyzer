## Known issues

It's been a long time since I've made any significant changes to this project. While getting it ready to set this up on github I noticed the minification for the JS didn't work. I'm not currently using it, so I've left it broken.

Additionally, this project was written when I was learning Angular, so I've put a lot of logic in controller functions that should have gone in link functions. The directory structure also uses their old recommendations.

This project isn't at the state I'd want it to be for a release, but every couple of months I get an email about the code, and if I wait until I'm happy with it I'll be waiting forever.

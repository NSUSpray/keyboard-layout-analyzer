# Keyboard Layout Analyzer

This is a project to analyze and compare various keyboard layouts by measuring a number of metrics, such as finger assignment, distance moved, and bigram analysis, based on a supplied input text.

**Visit [https://stevep99.github.io/keyboard-layout-analyzer/](https://stevep99.github.io/keyboard-layout-analyzer/) to run this analyzer.**

This project is a fork of the Keyboard Layout Analyzer app used on [patorjk.com](http://patorjk.com). 

A number of modifications have been made in this fork, with the intention improving the algorithm and making the analyzer more useful. These modifications are described in detail on the [About](https://stevep99.github.io/keyboard-layout-analyzer/index.html#/about) page.
